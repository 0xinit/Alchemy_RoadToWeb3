# OnChain NFT game -- ChainBattles

- Idea is to create something onChain without having IPFS store anything.
- There is Id, Level, HP, Strength, and Speed. 
- Id is set to start with 1 and remains constant for that certain NFT, and initial Level is set to 1 and is incremented everytime the NFT is trained.
- Finally, used Random method for HP, Strength and Speed, and then adding +5, +10, and +25 respectively each time an NFT is trained.
- Adding randomness to HP, Strength and Speed each time the NFT is trained is fairly simple, but figured to leave it like this since it doesn't make sense.
